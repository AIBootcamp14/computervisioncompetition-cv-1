2025-09-10 12:52:17 | ❌ [PIPELINE] Failed: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 140.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.99 GiB of which 0 bytes is free. Of the allocated memory 43.35 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 16.06 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)
